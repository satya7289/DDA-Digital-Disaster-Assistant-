    <h2>What is Earthquake?</h2>
    Earthquakes, temblors, quakes, tremors: These names are used to describe the sudden release of energy in the earth’s crust causing movement.
    <br><br>
    Terms associated with earthquakes:
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Earthquake</b>: A sudden and violent movement of a portion of the earth’s crust, and the series of vibrations that follow.</p>
    <p><b>Earths crust</b>: This is the solid thin layer that covers the outside of the earth. To put it in perspective, think of it as the skin on the outside of an apple.</p>
    <p><b>Plate</b>: A plate is a section of the earths crust. Plates slide along either beside, over or under each other, causing friction and pressure between the plates.</p>
    <p><b>Magnitude</b>: The amount of energy released during an earthquake, which is computed from the measurement of seismic waves.</p>
    <p><b>Fault</b>:  The gaping hole which can occur as a result of an earthquake. This hole can be the size of a small crack to the size of an olympic swimming pool or larger.</p>
    <p><b>Fault zones</b>: Where giant rock slabs that are made up of the earths crust collide and slide against each other regularly, causing the land to be unstable.</p>
    <p><b>Seismic waves</b>: These waves are the vibrations and movement that travel from the earthquake fault at very high speeds. The vibrations of these waves are what cause the most destruction during the earthquakes.</p>
    This gigantic release of energy creates what are known as ‘seismic waves’. These waves cause the one of the most terrifying and destructive acts of nature on the planet. These natural phenomena are sudden, violent shakes of the earth that are caused by the breaking and moving of the rock in the earths crust as it releases strained energy that has built up over a long period of time. Earthquakes occur when the energy has built up so long that is snaps and cause smashing and crashing under the earths surface and between the plates.

The ‘seismic activity’ of an area holds refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes that are experienced over a period of time. Frequency means the strength of the earthquake.

    <h2>Measurement of Earthquake</h2>
Measurement of earthquakes are measured using readings from instruments called seismometers. Scientists use the ‘magnitude rating’ to measure earthquakes. This rating measures the strength of the seismic waves and the period of time they lasted for. An earthquake measuring between 3 and 5 on the magnitude rating is considered normal. When they are between 3 and 5 there usually is not too much damage done, but the tremors can be felt in the ground. When the magnitude rating is between the numbers 5 and 7, this is regarded as moderate to strong. Earthquakes of this magnitude do not cause a huge amount of damage or loss of lives, but can leave some destruction in its trail, like cracks in the ground, landslides. Major earthquakes are rated between 7 and 8, and 8 or more is a seriously large natural disaster.

    <h2>Earthquake clusters</h2>
    <p>Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time. The ‘Ring of Fire’ is a rim along the Pacific Ocean where 80% of the planets earthquakes occur. These earthquakes are also due to the amount of volcanic activity in the area. In a 25000 mile horseshoe shape, the Ring of Fire causes a spontaneous series of faults, volcanic arcs, belts, plate movements  and oceanic trenches. The Ring of Fire contains 452 volcanoes, 75% of which are active. About 90% of the world’s earthquakes and 81% of the worlds largest earthquakes occur in this area.</p>
    <p>In general when a magnitude of 8 hits anywhere in the world  it can cause a lot of damages and loses. On average around 10,000 people die on a yearly basis due to earthquake. Most of the human deaths caused by the result of  earthquakes are collapsing buildings. The destruction of buildings, bridges and historical monuments is often caused by mudslides, floods, tsunami or fire. The small trembles that occur after a large earthquake can make rescue operations very difficult and impossible especially in areas surrounding buildings, bridges etc.</p>
