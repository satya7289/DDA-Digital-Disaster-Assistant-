    <h2>What are Landslides?</h2>
    <p>A landslide or landslip are a natural disaster, something which is unfortunately unavoidable. Landslides can vary in size but usually they always involve a large ground movement. This can be things such as debris and rock failing.  A landslide can occur on shore or off shore and usually at coastal lines but it is the gravity that forces the debris and rocks to fall and for a total landslide to occur</p>

<div>
    <h2>Causes of Landslide</h2>
    <p>When the stability of a slope decreases or changes, even just slightly, it can make the slope unstable. This means that with a large or even a small change, can cause a landslide.  However, there are many things that contribute to a landslides including;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Erosion – if this occurs, even just slightly, can make some of the slope to fall in to oceans or rivers.</li>
        <li>Glaciers can also have a landslide – there is not much of a different from a cliff top.  Instead, the ice melts or is subject to heavy rain and causes a slight shift from a glacier.</li>
        <li>Earthquakes – this brings about a sharp change in the slope and makes it unstable.</li>
        <li>Groundwater can destabilize the slope putting pressure on it greatly.</li>
        <li>Volcanoes erupting – this can cause the slope to become unstable.</li>
        <li>Soil structure can change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, these are all natural causes for a landslide to occur but human activities can contribute to cause a landslide.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heavy machine vibrations in the ground</li>
        <li>Deforestation can make fragile slopes unstable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What happens during a Landslide</h2>
    <p>When the cliff or slope’s soil has become saturated with water, it will mean there is a potential for a landslide to occur.  This can create debris or even a full on mud slide; but this can be very dangerous because it can product a surge or rock and mud.  This can cause houses, cars, trees and everything else in its path can be moved along within the landslide.</p>
    <p>Some landslides can block bridges and create a flood at the same time. However, there are times when the debris can be thought of as a flash flood. Mud and debris combined landslides can cause a lot of damage to properties as well as human life.  With landslides, it could cause blockage of water flowing through normally.</p>
